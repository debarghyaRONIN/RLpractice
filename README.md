# RLpractice

Checked out https://gymnasium.farama.org/ for understanding Reinforcement Learning implementation on games. 
i used https://pypi.org/project/gym-super-mario-bros/ for the environment as it is a free library but here's a catch

## Gymnasium is an updated api where it uses 5 specific variables to unpack: 
### observation,reward,terminated,truncated,info.

## The old Gym when it was under OpenAI had 4 specific variables:
### observation,reward,done(now terminated or truncated),info.

## This project is at the moment half fixed at this moment.

I encourage y'all to get hands on it and keep debugging! 

Thanks!
